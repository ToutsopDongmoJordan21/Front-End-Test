Task: A Front-end developer at DME SYSTEM, is expected to clearly communicate technical concepts, maintain legacy software systems and build new systems and be very transparent.

In the ReadMe file, there should be an explantaion of what your think are the use casses expressed in this designs and some critic if you have any on what could have been done better.


I.  Use case of the design

A use case describes a function that a system performs to achieve the user's goal. A use case must yield an observable result that is of value to the user of the system. Actors. An actor represents a role of a user that interacts with the system that you are modeling. In the system above, throw the picture; the activity of the user that that can come out of it are the following:

-- plan and manage his expenses

In fact, in this image, in the first graphic on the left, we can see that the user has the possibility to plan his expenses, first of all with his title which is "planning" and then we can see the amount that the user has in his account. Further down we can see that the user can plan his expenses like for example planning to buy a house and setting a deadline to reach it.

The user also has the possibility to see his spending history with the dates of the spending.

-- Access to his profile.

In the middle image you can see that the user can access his account with his registered credit card. He also has the possibility to see the amount of money in his account and see his different transaction history.

-- View these notifications

the user has the possibility to see the notifications on his account like for example the notifications on his expenses. and to see the notifications on his transactions per week.

-- evolution of these expenses per week, month or year

In the last image on the right we can see that the user can see the evolution of these expenses in the form of a graph with the highest and lowest expenses of the week, month or year.
Then these expenses are classified from the most recent to the least recent.


II. Critique

In relation to the reviews I don't really have any criticism about this design, because it is quite detailed of the user's tasks and any individual can easily understand. And the design really fits the users' tasks.
